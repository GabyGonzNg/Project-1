# Project-1
Air Quality is a key factor in public health, as pollutants such as Particulate Matter (PM) and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) have a significant impact on respiratory and cardiovascular health. The UNMC Water, Climate and Health Group composed of professional engineers and scientists’ aims to work on issues related to water, air, and soil pollution. In partnership with AirPurple monitors, UNMC is interested in understanding the factors that affect air quality in Nebraska. In this report, our engineering firm composed a series of analysis and findings related to the AirPurple data set from February 2024 to March 2025. Our team has focused on identifying potential hotspots that may be related to health concerns and how factors such as temperature, humidity, elevation, and geographic location can have an impact on air quality in Nebraska.
